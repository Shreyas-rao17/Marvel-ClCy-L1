# Fascinating Features of VI

### By Shreyas S Rao

## This Markdown Article is created using vi text editor on ubuntu. It breifly tells you about some salient features of VI text editor.
## Some features are: 


- It is very small. In fact, some versions have a total code size of less than 100KB. This makes it easy to include vi on even the tiniest versions of Linux, such as those in embedded systems and those that run from a single floppy disk.
- It is typist-friendly, at least once you get used to it. For example, the commands are very short, usually just a few keystrokes. And because vi does not use the mouse, there is never any need to remove one's hands from the keyboard. This can speed up editing substantially.
- It is very powerful, as just a few very short commands can make sweeping changes to large documents. In fact, vi is more powerful than most of its users realize, and few of them know more than just fraction of all the commands. 
- ### Modal Editing
VI can be used in 2 modes. At first, it seems quite irritating but these model help make vi mouse or cursor free. It can be used as a keyboard only editor so typing into a vi file becomes much faster. 
- ### Customizable
- ### Syntax Highlighting
- ### Search and replace
vi has a total of approximately 150 basic commands. However, it is only necessary to know about a dozen of them in order to be able to use it effectively. And you can become really fast after you have learned about two dozen

## I hope this helped you know something about vi and inspired to try it out on your own.
